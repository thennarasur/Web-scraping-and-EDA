**Description**   

*Web scraping and data cleaning*   
I scrape data from a travel agency's website. And I collect different details about the different places. As this is a scraped data it contains lot of unnecessary
text. we extract only necessary details. we export clean data to a csv file to do an exploratory analysis.

*Exploratory analysis*   
In exploratory analysis we analyse the dataset to find useful important insights.  I use descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore different aspects of the tourist places.

**Conclusion**   
With this analysis we can better know the best places to visit in india and tailor the packages according to the users taste.
